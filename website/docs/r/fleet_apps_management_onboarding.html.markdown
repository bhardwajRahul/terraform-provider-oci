## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "oci_fleet_apps_management_onboarding" "test_onboarding" {
  #Required
  compartment_id = var.compartment_id

  #Optional
  is_cost_tracking_tag_enabled = var.onboarding_is_cost_tracking_tag_enabled
  is_fams_tag_enabled          = var.onboarding_is_fams_tag_enabled
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `compartment_id` - (Required) Tenancy OCID
* `is_cost_tracking_tag_enabled` - (Optional) A value determining if the cost tracking tag is enabled or not. Allow
  Fleet Application Management to tag resources with cost tracking tag using "Oracle$FAMS-Tags.FAMSManaged" tag.
* `is_fams_tag_enabled` - (Optional) A value determining if the Fleet Application Management tagging is enabled or not.
  Allow Fleet Application Management to tag resources with fleet name using "Oracle$FAMS-Tags.FleetName" tag.

** IMPORTANT **
Any change to a property that does not support update will force the destruction and recreation of the resource with the
new property values
