<h1>Data Source: oci_capacity_management_occm_demand_signals</h1>

<p>This data source provides the list of Occm Demand Signals in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Capacity Management service.</p>

<p>This GET call is used to list all demand signals within the compartment passed as a query parameter.</p>

<h2>Example Usage</h2>

<pre><code class="language-hcl">data &quot;oci_capacity_management_occm_demand_signals&quot; &quot;test_occm_demand_signals&quot; {
	#Required
	compartment_id = var.compartment_id

	#Optional
	display_name = var.occm_demand_signal_display_name
	id = var.occm_demand_signal_id
	lifecycle_details = var.occm_demand_signal_lifecycle_details
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Argument Reference</h2>

<p>The following arguments are supported:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>compartment_id</code> - (Required) The ocid of the compartment or tenancy in which resources are to be listed. This will also be used for authorization purposes.</li>
<li><code>display_name</code> - (Optional) A filter to return only the resources that match the entire display name. The match is not case sensitive.</li>
<li><code>id</code> - (Optional) A query parameter to filter the list of demand signals based on it&rsquo;s OCID.</li>
<li><code>lifecycle_details</code> - (Optional) A query parameter to filter the list of demand signals based on its state.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Attributes Reference</h2>

<p>The following attributes are exported:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>occm_demand_signal_collection</code> - The list of occm_demand_signal_collection.</li>
</ul>

<h3>OccmDemandSignal Reference</h3>

<p>The following attributes are exported:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>compartment_id</code> - The OCID of the tenancy from which the request to create the demand signal was made.</p></li>

<li><p><code>defined_tags</code> - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: <code>{&quot;foo-namespace.bar-key&quot;: &quot;value&quot;}</code></p></li>

<li><p><code>description</code> - Meaningful text about the demand signal.</p></li>

<li><p><code>display_name</code> - The display name of the demand signal.</p></li>

<li><p><code>freeform_tags</code> - Simple key-value pair that is applied without any predefined name, type or scope. Exists for cross-compatibility only. Example: <code>{&quot;bar-key&quot;: &quot;value&quot;}</code></p></li>

<li><p><code>id</code> - The OCID of the demand signal.</p></li>

<li><p><code>lifecycle_details</code> - The different states associated with a demand signal.</p>

<p>CREATED -&gt; A demand signal is by default created in this state.  SUBMITTED -&gt; Once you have reviewed the details of the demand signal, you can transition it to SUBMITTED state so that Oracle Cloud Infrastructure can start working on it. DELETED -&gt; You can delete a demand signal as long as it is in either CREATED or SUBMITTED state. IN_PROGRESS -&gt; Once Oracle Cloud Infrastructure starts working on a given demand signal. They transition it to IN_PROGRESS. CANCELLED -&gt; Oracle Cloud Infrastructure can transition the demand signal to this state. COMPLETED -&gt; Oracle Cloud Infrastructure will transition the demand signal to COMPLETED state once the quantities which Oracle Cloud Infrastructure committed to deliver to you has been delivered.</p></li>

<li><p><code>state</code> - The current lifecycle state of the resource.</p></li>

<li><p><code>system_tags</code> - System tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. Example: <code>{&quot;orcl-cloud.free-tier-retained&quot;: &quot;true&quot;}</code></p></li>

<li><p><code>time_created</code> - The time when the demand signal was created.</p></li>

<li><p><code>time_updated</code> - The time when the demand signal was last updated.</p></li>
</ul>
