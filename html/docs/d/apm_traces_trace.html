<h1>Data Source: oci_apm_traces_trace</h1>

<p>This data source provides details about a specific Trace resource in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Apm Traces service.</p>

<p>Gets the trace details identified by traceId.</p>

<h2>Example Usage</h2>

<pre><code class="language-hcl">data &quot;oci_apm_traces_trace&quot; &quot;test_trace&quot; {
	#Required
	apm_domain_id = oci_apm_apm_domain.test_apm_domain.id
	trace_key = var.trace_trace_key

	#Optional
	time_trace_started_greater_than_or_equal_to = var.trace_time_trace_started_greater_than_or_equal_to
	time_trace_started_less_than = var.trace_time_trace_started_less_than
	trace_namespace = var.trace_trace_namespace
}
</code></pre>

<h2>Argument Reference</h2>

<p>The following arguments are supported:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>apm_domain_id</code> - (Required) The APM Domain ID for the intended request.</li>
<li><code>time_trace_started_greater_than_or_equal_to</code> - (Optional) Include traces that have a minTraceStartTime equal to or greater than this value.</li>
<li><code>time_trace_started_less_than</code> - (Optional) Include traces that have a minTraceStartTime less than this value.</li>
<li><code>trace_key</code> - (Required) Unique Application Performance Monitoring trace identifier (traceId).</li>
<li><code>trace_namespace</code> - (Optional) Name space from which the trace details need to be retrieved.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Attributes Reference</h2>

<p>The following attributes are exported:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>error_span_count</code> - The number of spans with errors that have been processed by the system for the trace. Note that the number of spans with errors will be less than or equal to the total number of spans in the trace.<br>
</li>
<li><code>is_fault</code> - Boolean flag that indicates whether the trace has an error.</li>
<li><code>key</code> - Unique identifier (traceId) for the trace that represents the span set.  Note that this field is defined as traceKey in the API and it maps to the traceId in the trace data in Application Performance Monitoring.</li>
<li><code>root_span_duration_in_ms</code> - Time taken for the root span operation to complete in milliseconds.</li>
<li><code>root_span_operation_name</code> - Root span name associated with the trace. This is the flow start operation name. Null is displayed if the root span is not yet completed.</li>
<li><code>root_span_service_name</code> - Service associated with the trace.</li>
<li><code>service_summaries</code> - A summary of the spans by service.

<ul>
<li><code>error_spans</code> - Number of spans with errors for serviceName in the trace.</li>
<li><code>span_service_name</code> - Name associated with the service.</li>
<li><code>total_spans</code> - Number of spans for serviceName in the trace.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>source_name</code> - Source of trace (traces, syn_traces).</li>
<li><code>span_count</code> - The number of spans that have been processed by the system for the trace.  Note that there could be additional spans that have not been processed or reported yet if the trace is still in progress.</li>
<li><code>span_summary</code> - Summary of the information pertaining to the spans in the trace window that is being queried.

<ul>
<li><code>error_span_count</code> - The number of spans with errors that have been processed by the system for the trace. Note that the number of spans with errors will be less than or equal to the total number of spans in the trace.<br>

<li><code>total_spans</code> - Number of spans for serviceName in the trace.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>span_count</code> - The number of spans that have been processed by the system for the trace.  Note that there could be additional spans that have not been processed or reported yet if the trace is still in progress.</li>
